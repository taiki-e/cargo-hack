            When this flag is not used together with --exclude-features (--skip) and

            --all-features flag.

            Perform for the feature powerset of the package.

            This also includes runs with just --no-default-features flag, and default features.

            When this flag is used together with --depth or namespaced features (-Z
            namespaced-features) and not used together with --exclude-features (--skip) and
            --include-features and there are multiple features, this also includes runs with just
            --all-features flag.

            Space or comma separated list of features to exclude.

            To exclude run of default feature, using value `--exclude-features default`.

            To exclude run of just --no-default-features flag, using --exclude-no-default-features
            flag.

            To exclude run of just --all-features flag, using --exclude-all-features flag.

            Perform commands on a specified (inclusive) range of Rust versions.

            If the upper bound of the range is omitted, the latest stable compiler is used as the
            upper bound.

            If the lower bound of the range is omitted, the value of the `rust-version` field in
            `Cargo.toml` is used as the lower bound.

            Note that ranges are always inclusive ranges.

        --version-step <NUM>
            Specify the version interval of --version-range (default to `1`).

            This flag can only be used together with --version-range flag.

            will be removed before each run.

            Note that dependencies artifacts will be preserved.

        --clean-per-version
            Remove artifacts per Rust version.

        --print-command-list
            Print commands without run (Unstable).

        --no-manifest-path
            Do not pass --manifest-path option to cargo (Unstable).

    -v, --verbose
            Use verbose output.

Some common cargo commands are (see all commands with --list):
    build       Compile the current package
    check       Analyze the current package and report errors, but don't build object files
    run         Run a binary or example of the local package
    test        Run the tests

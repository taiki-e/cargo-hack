        --all
            Alias for --workspace.

        --workspace
            Perform command for all packages in the workspace.

        --exclude <SPEC>...
            Exclude packages from the check.

            This also includes runs with just --no-default-features flag, and default features.

            When this flag is not used together with --exclude-features (--skip) and
            --include-features and there are multiple features, this also includes runs with just
            --all-features flag.

        --feature-powerset
            Perform for the feature powerset of the package.

            This also includes runs with just --no-default-features flag, and default features.

            When this flag is used together with --depth or namespaced features (-Z
            namespaced-features) and not used together with --exclude-features (--skip) and
            --include-features and there are multiple features, this also includes runs with just
            --all-features flag.

        --optional-deps [DEPS]...
            Use optional dependencies as features.

            If DEPS are not specified, all optional dependencies are considered as features.

            To exclude run of default feature, using value `--exclude-features default`.

            To exclude run of just --no-default-features flag, using --exclude-no-default-features
            flag.

            To exclude run of just --all-features flag, using --exclude-all-features flag.

            This flag can only be used together with either --each-feature flag or
            --feature-powerset flag.

        --exclude-no-default-features

            --feature-powerset flag.

        --depth <NUM>
            Specify a max number of simultaneous feature flags of --feature-powerset.

            If NUM is set to 1, --feature-powerset is equivalent to --each-feature.

            This flag can only be used together with --feature-powerset flag.

        --group-features <FEATURES>...
            Space or comma separated list of features to group.

            This treats the specified features as if it were a single feature.

        --include-features <FEATURES>...
            Include only the specified features in the feature combinations instead of package
            features.

            This flag can only be used together with either --each-feature flag or
            --feature-powerset flag.

        --no-dev-deps
            Perform without dev-dependencies.

            Note that this flag removes dev-dependencies from real `Cargo.toml` while cargo-hack is
            running and restores it when finished.

        --remove-dev-deps
            Equivalent to --no-dev-deps flag except for does not restore the original `Cargo.toml`
            after performed.

        --no-private
            Perform without `publish = false` crates.

        --ignore-private

        --ignore-unknown-features
            Skip passing --features flag to `cargo` if that feature does not exist in the package.

            This flag can be used with --features, --include-features, or --group-features.

        --rust-version
            Perform commands on `package.rust-version`.

            This cannot be used with --version-range.

        --version-range [START]..[=END]
            Perform commands on a specified (inclusive) range of Rust versions.

            If the upper bound of the range is omitted, the latest stable compiler is used as the
            upper bound.

            If the lower bound of the range is omitted, the value of the `rust-version` field in
            `Cargo.toml` is used as the lower bound.

            Note that ranges are always inclusive ranges.

        --version-step <NUM>
            Specify the version interval of --version-range (default to `1`).

            This flag can only be used together with --version-range flag.

        --clean-per-run
            Remove artifacts for that package before running the command.

            If used this flag with --workspace, --each-feature, or --feature-powerset, artifacts
            will be removed before each run.

            Note that dependencies artifacts will be preserved.

        --clean-per-version
            Remove artifacts per Rust version.

            Note that dependencies artifacts will also be removed.

            This flag can only be used together with --version-range flag.

        --keep-going
            Keep going on failure.

        --partition <M/N>
            Partition runs and execute only its subset according to M/N.

        --log-group <KIND>
            Log grouping: none, github-actions.

            If this option is not used, the environment will be automatically detected.

        --print-command-list
            Print commands without run (Unstable).

        --no-manifest-path
            Do not pass --manifest-path option to cargo (Unstable).

    -v, --verbose
            Use verbose output.

        --color <WHEN>
            Coloring: auto, always, never.

            This flag will be propagated to cargo.

    -h, --help
            Prints help information.

    -V, --version
            Prints version information.

Some common cargo commands are (see all commands with --list):
    build       Compile the current package
    check       Analyze the current package and report errors, but don't build object files
    run         Run a binary or example of the local package
    test        Run the tests
```

</details>

`cargo-hack` is basically wrapper of `cargo` that propagates subcommand and most
of the passed flags to `cargo`, but provides additional flags and changes the
behavior of some existing flags.

### --each-feature

Perform for each feature which includes default features and
`--no-default-features` of the package.

This is useful to check that each feature is working properly. (When used for
this purpose, it is recommended to use with `--no-dev-deps` to avoid
[cargo#4866].)

```sh
cargo hack check --each-feature --no-dev-deps
```

See also [Options for adjusting the behavior of --each-feature and --feature-powerset](#options-for-adjusting-the-behavior-of---each-feature-and---feature-powerset) section.

### --feature-powerset

Perform for the feature powerset which includes `--no-default-features` and
default features of the package.

This is useful to check that every combination of features is working
properly. (When used for this purpose, it is recommended to use with
`--no-dev-deps` to avoid [cargo#4866].)

```sh
cargo hack check --feature-powerset --no-dev-deps
```

cargo-hack deduplicate any fully equivalent feature combinations based on how the cargo features work. Therefore, it may be more efficient than checking all feature combinations in other ways.

When using this flag results in a very large number of feature combinations, consider using [`--depth`](#--depth) option.

See also [Options for adjusting the behavior of --each-feature and --feature-powerset](#options-for-adjusting-the-behavior-of---each-feature-and---feature-powerset) section.

### Options for adjusting the behavior of --each-feature and --feature-powerset

The following flags can be used with `--each-feature` and `--feature-powerset`.

#### --optional-deps

Use optional dependencies as features.

This flag treats all option dependencies as features by default.
To treat only specific dependencies as features, pass a space or comma separated list.

```sh
cargo hack check --feature-powerset --optional-deps deps1,deps2
```

#### --exclude-features, --skip

Space or comma separated list of features to exclude.

```sh
cargo hack check --feature-powerset --exclude-features feature1,feature2
cargo hack check --feature-powerset --skip feature1,feature2
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### --depth

Specify a max number of simultaneous feature flags of `--feature-powerset`.

If the number is set to 1, `--feature-powerset` is equivalent to
`--each-feature`.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### --group-features

Space or comma separated list of features to group.

This treats the specified features as if it were a single feature.

To specify multiple groups, use this option multiple times:
`--group-features a,b --group-features c,d`

### --rust-version

Perform commands on the Rust version of `package.rust-version` field in `Cargo.toml`

### --version-range

Perform commands on a specified (inclusive) range of Rust versions.

```console
$ cargo hack check --version-range 1.46..=1.47
info: running `rustup run 1.46 cargo check` on cargo-hack (1/2)
...
info: running `rustup run 1.47 cargo check` on cargo-hack (2/2)
...
```

(We use `rustup run <toolchain> cargo` instead of `cargo +<toolchain>` to work around a [rustup bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3036).)

This might be useful for catching issues like [termcolor#35], [regex#685],
[rust-clippy#6324].

If the upper bound of the range is omitted, the latest stable compiler is used as the upper bound.

If the lower bound of the range is omitted, the value of the `rust-version` field in `Cargo.toml` is used as the lower bound.

You can specify the version interval by using `--version-step`.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --no-dev-deps

Perform without dev-dependencies.

This is a workaround for an issue that dev-dependencies leaking into normal
build ([cargo#4866]).

Also, this can be used as a workaround for an issue that `cargo` does not
allow publishing a package with cyclic dev-dependencies. ([cargo#4242])

```sh
cargo hack publish --no-dev-deps --dry-run --allow-dirty
```

Note: Currently, using `--no-dev-deps` flag removes dev-dependencies from
real manifest while cargo-hack is running and restores it when finished.
See [cargo#4242] for why this is necessary.
Also, this behavior may change in the future on some subcommands. See also
[#15].

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --remove-dev-deps

Equivalent to `--no-dev-deps` except for does not restore the original
`Cargo.toml` after execution.

This is useful to know what Cargo.toml that cargo-hack is actually using
with `--no-dev-deps`.

*This flag also works without subcommands.*

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --ignore-private

Skip to perform on `publish = false` crates.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --no-private

Perform without `publish = false` crates. This is similar to `--ignore-private`, but is more powerful because this also prevents private crates from affecting lockfile and metadata.

Note: `--no-private` flag modifies `Cargo.toml` while cargo-hack is running and restores it when finished.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --ignore-unknown-features

Skip passing `--features` to `cargo` if that feature does not exist.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### --clean-per-run

Remove artifacts for that package before running the command.

This also works as a workaround for [rust-clippy#4612].

### Improvement of the behavior of existing cargo flags

`cargo-hack` changes the behavior of the following existing flags.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### --features, --no-default-features

Unlike `cargo` ([cargo#3620], [cargo#4106], [cargo#4463], [cargo#4753],
[cargo#5015], [cargo#5364], [cargo#6195]), it can also be applied to
sub-crates.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### --all, --workspace

Perform command for all packages in the workspace.

Unlike cargo, it does not compile all members at once.

For example, running `cargo hack check --all` in a workspace with members
`foo` and `bar` behaves almost the same as the following script:

```sh
# If you use cargo-hack, you don't need to maintain this list manually.
members=("foo" "bar")

for member in "${members[@]}"; do
    cargo check --manifest-path "${member}/Cargo.toml"
done
```

*Workspace members will be performed according to the order of the 'packages'
fields of [`cargo metadata`][cargo-metadata].*

## Installation

<!-- omit in toc -->
### From source

```sh
cargo +stable install cargo-hack --locked
```

Currently, installing cargo-hack requires rustc 1.70+.

cargo-hack is usually runnable with Cargo versions older than the Rust version
required for installation (e.g., `cargo +1.31 hack check`). Currently, to run
cargo-hack requires Cargo 1.26+.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### From prebuilt binaries

You can download prebuilt binaries from the [Release page](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/releases).
Prebuilt binaries are available for macOS, Linux (gnu and musl), Windows (static executable), FreeBSD, and illumos.

<details>
<summary>Example of script to download cargo-hack</summary>

```sh
# Get host target
host=$(rustc -vV | grep '^host:' | cut -d' ' -f2)
# Download binary and install to $HOME/.cargo/bin
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/releases/latest/download/cargo-hack-$host.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C "$HOME/.cargo/bin"
```

</details>

<!-- omit in toc -->
### On GitHub Actions

You can use [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action) to install prebuilt binaries on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

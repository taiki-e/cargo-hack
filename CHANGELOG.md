## [0.6.24] - 2024-04-01

- Respect the existing `Cargo.lock` with `--version-range`/`--rust-version` except when necessary to work around old cargo bugs. ([#242](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/242))

- Support mixed MSRV in `--version-range` option. ([#213](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/213), thanks @epage)

  Previously, crates in a workspace must have the same MSRVs, but that restriction is now removed.

- Support `..=` as inclusive range syntax for `--version-range` option to match Rust's inclusive range syntax. ([#198](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/198))

  The old inclusive range syntax is now deprecated, but continues to be supported.

- Group logs on GitHub Actions. ([#206](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/206), [#214](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/214))

  <img width="778" alt="log-group" src="https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/assets/43724913/7ef0baa3-37d2-466f-b7be-5b5d135c1bfc">

  This can be opt-out by using `--log-group=none`, and can be force-enabled by `--log-group=github-actions`.

- Work around a rustup bug ([rust-lang/rustup#3036](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3036)) on Windows. ([#209](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/209))

## [0.6.5] - 2023-09-04

- Add `--at-least-one-of` flag. ([#193](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/193), thanks @kornelski)

- Fix bug in `--no-private` flag with virtual workspace.

## [0.6.3] - 2023-08-28

- Fix bug in `--no-private` flag on Windows.

## [0.6.2] - 2023-08-28

- Work around spurious "failed to select a version" error when `--version-range` option is used.

  (This does *not* work around the [underlying cargo bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10623).)

## [0.6.1] - 2023-08-28

- Fix bug in `--no-private` flag.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-08-28

- Add `--no-private` flag to exclude `publish = false` crates.

  This flag is more powerful than [`--ignore-private` flag](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack#--ignore-private), because this also prevents private crates from affecting lockfile and metadata.

- Restore `Cargo.lock` after run to match behavior with [cargo-minimal-versions](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-minimal-versions) and [cargo-no-dev-deps](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-no-dev-deps), when `--no-dev-deps`, `--remove-dev-deps`, or `--no-private` is used.

- Documentation improvements.

## [0.5.28] - 2023-02-28

## [0.5.24] - 2022-12-03

- Pin `libc` to 0.2.137 to work around build failure on FreeBSD. ([#174](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/174))

## [0.5.22] - 2022-10-25

- Update `toml_edit` to 0.15.

  This increases the rustc version required to build cargo-hack. (rustc 1.56+ -> 1.60+)
  The cargo/rustc version required to run cargo-hack remains unchanged. (cargo 1.26+)

## [0.5.21] - 2022-09-26

- Improve handling of multiple `--target` options on older cargo. ([#169](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/169))

## [0.5.20] - 2022-09-24

- Support multiple `--target` options. This uses cargo 1.64's [multi-target builds](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/09/22/Rust-1.64.0.html#cargo-improvements-workspace-inheritance-and-multi-target-builds) on cargo 1.64+, otherwise fallback to perform command per targets. ([#168](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/168))

## [0.5.19] - 2022-09-22

- Fix "failed to parse `rust-version` field from manifest" error when workspace inheritance is used. ([#165](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/165))

## [0.5.18] - 2022-09-04

- Allow empty strings in `--features` (`-F`), `--exclude-features` (`--skip`), `--include-features`.
  Passing an empty string to them is now considered the same as not passing the flag. See [#163](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/163) for more.

## [0.5.17] - 2022-08-12

- Distribute prebuilt binaries for x86_64 FreeBSD. ([#160](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/160))

## [0.5.16] - 2022-07-30

- Fix an issue that a warning was displayed when excluding a feature that exists only in some crates in the workspace. ([#158](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/158))

- Support namespaced features (features with `dep:` prefix). ([#154](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/154))

- Fix handling of quoted keys in `--no-dev-deps` and `--remove-dev-deps`. ([#152](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/152))

  This increases the rustc version required to build cargo-hack. (rustc 1.46+ -> 1.56+)
  The cargo/rustc version required to run cargo-hack remains unchanged. (cargo 1.26+)

  This also increases the compile time of cargo-hack. Consider [installing cargo-hack from prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack#from-prebuilt-binaries).

- Add metadata for cargo binstall.

- Add `--keep-going` flag. ([#140](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/140))

- Fix an issue where `--feature-powerset` and `--each-feature` add `--all-features` as one of the combinations, even if it is already covered by another combination. ([#141](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack/pull/141))

## [0.5.8] - 2021-10-13
